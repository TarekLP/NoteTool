## Tarek's incredible Note Tool

# Introduction
This tool is my own version of Trello and Clickup (Which ive used very actively in the past but ive always been turned off by their AI features / paid features).
This version has some basic functionality of organizing notes, exporting them as json, adding goals / due dates / assignees and comments.


# Installation
Make sure you have the JDK installed or use the JRE that comes with the releases.
Download the release zip
Extract it into a folder (both the EXE and JRE Folder)
Run the exe and pray to god that it runs.
