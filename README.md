## Notey

# Introduction
This tool is my own version of Trello and Clickup (Which ive used very actively in the past but ive always been turned off by their AI features / paid features).
This version has functionality for organizing notes, exporting them as json, adding goals / due dates / assignees and comments.

## Key Features
*   Kanban-style boards with customizable columns.
*   Hierarchical goals (sub-tasks) with progress tracking.
*   Note dependencies (e.g., "blocks", "is blocked by") with visual indicators.
*   File attachments and note linking directly within goals (`@NoteName`).

# Installation
Make sure you have the JDK installed or use the JRE that comes with the releases.
Download the release zip
Extract it into a folder (both the EXE and JRE Folder)
Run the exe and pray to god that it runs.
